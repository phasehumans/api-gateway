### Operating System

- what is operating system?
    - need of manager betn hardware and software
    - main program that controls the entrire computer and acts has manager betn hardware and user applications
    - is abstraction layer(hide complexity)
    - process management (cpu control)
    - memory management (ram control)
    - file system (disk control)
    - device management
    - security and permissions
- types of os?
    - batch os
    - time sharing os
    - multi tasking os - mac, win, linux
    - real-time os - qnx, missile sys, airbags
    - distributed os - locus
    - embedded os 
- diff betn multiprogramming, multiprocess, multitasking, multithreading?
    - multiprogramming
        - multi programs in memory, if one waits, cpu runs another
        - to keep cpu busy
    - multitasking
        - cpu switches very fast betn tasks so user feels parallel execution
        - user interactivity becomes smooth
    - multiprocessing
        - use multiple cpus/cores to execute multiple processes at same time; for true parallel execution
        - real concurrency and parallesim
    - multithreading
        - use multiple threads inside a single process
        - threads share memory, files and resources
        - use to avoid process overhead
- what is process, threads, programs?
    - program
        - code in file disk
        - passive set of instructions stored on disk
        - not runnig, not using any resources
    - process
        - running instance of program
        - each process is allocated w/ resources like ram, cpu, id, stack, heap, prgm cnt
    - thread
        - smallest unit of execution inside a process
        - one process, many threads
        - all threads share same memory, heap, files, code
        - but diffn stack, registers, execution flow
- what are various process states?
    - new state: process just started, allocation of resources, process structure
    - ready state: process is ready to run, waiting for cpu
    - run state: process is executing
    - wait/blocked state: when process need io; read file, network req, kbd inputs
    - terminated/exit state: execution done, frees resources
    - suspended state: removes process from ram to disk; too many process or memory pressure

- what is kernel?
    - layer that controls hardware, manages resources and provide safe env for prgrm to execute
- what is ipc?
    - inter process communication
    - process are isolated for safety but still need to cooperate
    - set of mechansim that allows isolated processes to communicate and synchronise safely via kernel
    - process1 <---> process2
    - ipc mechnaisms:
        - signals
        - pipes - one way data flow
        - message queues
        - shared memory - kernel created memory region to acces by both process
        - sockets - communicate to process on diff machine
- what is system calls?
    - application ----> systen calls ----> kernel ---> hardware
    - controlled way for user prgm to request services from kernel
- what are diffn memory present in computer system?
    - cpu registers
    - cache memory
    - ram (main memory)
    - secondary storage (ssd/hdd)
    - fastest to slowest: reg -> cache (l1,l2,l3) -> ram -> ssd -> hdd
- what are cpu/process scheduling algo?
    - deciding which process gets cpu, when and for how long
    - optimaztion for high cpu util and throughput, low waiting time, response time, no starvation
    - first come first serve(fcfs)
        - execute based on arrival order
        - covoy effect
    - shortest job first(sjf)
        - run process w/ smallest cpu burst time first
    - shortest remainig time first(srtf)
        - if shorter job arrive, pause current job and run shorter one
    - priority scheduling
        - run highest priority process
        - starvation
    - round robin
        - each process a equal cpu turn
        - high context switch
    - multi level queue scheduling(mlq)
        - multiple queus; sys, interactive, batch queue
        - each queue has its own scheduling algo
- what is concurrency?
    - dealing with multiple tasks at the same time by overlapping their execution
    - diffn from parallesim
    - it creates race condn, deadlocks, starvation, data corruption
    - types:
        - multi-threading; java, c++
        - eventloop/async model, js
        - actor model, go
- what is critical section problem?
    - multiple threads accessed and modified same data concurrently
    - ex. bank balance; leads to race condn
    - critical section is part of prgm that access shared resources and must be execute by only one thread at time
    - how to we ensure, which thread enters csection at a time, ie critical section problem
    - req for soln of csproblem; mutual exclusion, progress, no starvation
    - soln is synchrnization mechanism
        - what is process synchronization or synchronization mechnaism?
            - lack of cordination betn multi concurrent process
            - leads to sycn mechanism
            - mutex(lock) - lock the resource
            - semaphore - limited numbers of threads
- what is deadlock?
    - circular dependency betn tasks and resources
    - condn for deadlock
        - mutual exclusion: resouce is use one at a time
        - hold and wait
        - no preemption: can forcefuly taken away resources
        - circular wait
- what are deadlock handling techniques?
    - deadlock prevention
        - prevent 4 condn to occur at same time
    - deadlock avoidance
        - bankers algorithm
    - deadlock detection and recovery
        - check for cyclic graph
        - kill process
        - rollback
    - deadlock ignorance
        - rare, so do nothing
- what is memory management techniuqes and contigious memory allocation?
    - contigous memory allocation
        - each process occupy conti block of memory
        - [ P1 ][     Free     ][  P2  ][  Free ]
        - placement strategies:
            - first fit: first free block that is large enough
            - best fit: pick smallest free block that is big enough
            - worst fit: pick the largest free block
        - leads to fragmentation
    - non-contigous memory allocation
        - store a single process in multi separate blocks
        - [ P1 ][ P1 ][ P1 ][ P1 ]
        - paging
            - what is pagging?
                - logical and physical memeory is divided into fixsize blocks
                - logical memory(virtual) -> pages
                - physical memory(ram)-> frames
                - process memory: Page 0 | Page 1 | Page 2 | Page 3
                - ram: Frame 5 | Frame 2 | Frame 9 | Frame 1
                - page table for page -> frame
                - page table is needed to find scattered pages in ram
        - segmentation
            - what is segmentation?
                - divided into meaningful parts not equal chunks
                - Code | Data | Heap | Stack
        - use segmentation + paging
        - prgm sees logical segments, os breaks into pages internally
- what is virtual memory?
    - memory management technique where the OS uses disk space to extend RAM, giving each process the illusion of having a very large, continuous memory space
    - partly in ram, partly in disk but map dynamically
    - prgrm need small active portion, only that pages load in ram, remaning in disk
    - when other page needed that is not in ram, cpu raise page fault
    - find in that page in disk load it in ram
    - swapping: pages moving ram to disk
    - thrashing: sys is spending more time to move pages than executing
    - prgrm -> virtual address -> mmu -> page table -> ram -> disk (if page fault)
- what are page replacement algorithms?
    - decide which page to remove from ram when new page needed to be loaded
    - first in first out(fifo) - remove oldest
    - least recently used(lru) - least recently used page
    - clock algorithm(second chance) - circular order, give second chance, most used*
    - least frequently used(lfu)
    - random replacement
